"""BTC trading environment. Trains on BTC price history to learn to buy/sell/hold.

This is an environment tailored towards TensorForce, not OpenAI Gym. Gym environments are
a standard used by many projects (Baselines, Coach, etc) and so would make sense to use; and TForce is compatible with
Gym envs. It's just that there's hoops to go through converting a Gym env to TForce, and it was ugly code. I actually
had it that way, you can search through Git if you want the Gym env; but one day I decided "I'm not having success with
any of these other projects, TForce is the best - I'm just gonna stick to that" and this approach was cleaner.

I actually do want to try NervanaSystems/Coach, that one's new since I started developing. Will require converting this
env back to Gym format. Anyone wanna give it a go?

    this gives more flexibility, but it's basically the same thing. Someone may want to check me on that statement by
    reading those docs and trying TForce's preprocessing instead of this.

    One important bit here is the use of RobustScaler with a quantile_range. This allows us to handle outliers, which
    abound in the data. Sometimes we have a timeseries hole, and suddenly we're up a billion percent. Sometimes whales
    pump-and-dump to screw with the market. RobustScaler lets us "ignore" those moments.
